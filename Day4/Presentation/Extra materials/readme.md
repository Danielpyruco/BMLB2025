## What is this?

This presentation goes into the specifics of clustering as it pertains to the clustering of biological sequences. Specifically, these slides address the catch-22 in biological sequence alignment and dive into how modern tools do progressive tree alignment. Since 
it is a bit of an outlier relative to the core ML topics I have tagged it as extra material for now. This is subject to change before Thursday. No practical exercises involving this material will be given, but depending on how far we get (part of) the material in 
this lecture might be asked for on the exam. Probably not, though.
